## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 19 added: Gemini hooks support
- Phase 20 added: Gemini CLI support and Gemini hooks support
- Phase 21 added: Copilot CLI support and Copilot hooks support

### Decisions

All v1.4 decisions archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md.

v1.6 roadmap decisions:
- Use java-junit parsing for Playwright JUnit output (reliable check publishing)
- Gate full OS matrix to main while keeping develop PRs on Ubuntu only
- Phase 11 first: Fix rename + settings foundation (foundation for all other features)
- Phase 12: Monaco editor enhancements (memory management must be correct before building on top)
- Phase 13: Log viewer (high user value, streaming patterns inform other features)
- Phase 14: Config management (enables workflows, file watching patterns reused)
- Phase 15: Debug simulator (needs settings panel from Phase 11 for binary path)
- Phase 16: Onboarding (polish layer after core features working)
- Phase 17: E2E testing (validate all features before release)

Phase 11 decisions:
- Persist settings under a single settings key with localStorage fallback to keep defaults consistent across Tauri and web modes.

Phase 20 decisions:
- Map Gemini BeforeTool/AfterTool to RuleZ PreToolUse/PostToolUse while preserving the original hook_event_name in tool_input.
- Translate RuleZ context to Gemini systemMessage by default, with JSON tool_input override for tool hooks.
- Ensure gemini_hook_event_name is included in tool_input overrides for Gemini tool events
