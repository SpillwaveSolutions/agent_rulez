<objective>
Fix the directory path mismatch in .github/workflows/e2e.yml by replacing all 'rulez_ui' references with 'rulez-ui'.

Purpose: The existing e2e.yml uses 'rulez_ui' (underscore) but the actual directory is 'rulez-ui' (hyphen). This causes path-based triggers to never fire, working-directory to fail, and artifact uploads to find nothing. This is a prerequisite for the Tauri CI build workflow (10-02) which also needs correct E2E test execution.
Output: Fixed e2e.yml with all paths corrected.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix all rulez_ui references to rulez-ui in e2e.yml</name>
  <files>.github/workflows/e2e.yml</files>
  <action>
Replace ALL occurrences of `rulez_ui` with `rulez-ui` in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`. There are 7 locations to fix:

1. **Line 2 comment** (cosmetic): Update the comment from "rulez_ui" to "rulez-ui" if present.

2. **Line 12 push paths** (functional): Change `'rulez_ui/**'` to `'rulez-ui/**'`

3. **Line 17 pull_request paths** (functional): Change `'rulez_ui/**'` to `'rulez-ui/**'`

4. **Line 23 working-directory default** (functional): Change `working-directory: rulez_ui` to `working-directory: rulez-ui`

5. **Line 56 playwright-report artifact path** (functional): Change `path: rulez_ui/playwright-report/` to `path: rulez-ui/playwright-report/`

6. **Line 64 test-results artifact path** (functional): Change `path: rulez_ui/test-results/` to `path: rulez-ui/test-results/`

7. **Line 71 junit.xml path** (functional): Change `files: rulez_ui/test-results/junit.xml` to `files: rulez-ui/test-results/junit.xml`

Also update the top-of-file comment to reference `rulez-ui` (the correct directory name).

After editing, verify with a grep that ZERO occurrences of `rulez_ui` remain in the file.
  </action>
  <verify>
Search for `rulez_ui` across all workflow files — should return zero results:
```bash
grep -r "rulez_ui" .github/workflows/
```

Verify `rulez-ui` appears in the correct locations:
```bash
grep -n "rulez-ui" .github/workflows/e2e.yml
```
Should show 7+ lines with `rulez-ui`.

Validate YAML syntax:
```bash
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/e2e.yml'))"
```
  </verify>
  <done>
- All 7 occurrences of rulez_ui replaced with rulez-ui
- Path triggers correctly reference rulez-ui/**
- Working directory correctly set to rulez-ui
- Artifact paths correctly use rulez-ui/ prefix
- Zero occurrences of rulez_ui remain in any workflow file
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `grep -r "rulez_ui" .github/workflows/` returns zero results
2. `grep -c "rulez-ui" .github/workflows/e2e.yml` returns 7 or more
3. YAML is syntactically valid (python3 yaml.safe_load or similar)
4. The workflow structure is unchanged — only directory names updated
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Zero occurrences of 'rulez_ui' in .github/workflows/e2e.yml
- All path triggers use 'rulez-ui/**'
- Working directory is 'rulez-ui'
- Artifact upload paths use 'rulez-ui/' prefix
- YAML is valid
</success_criteria>
