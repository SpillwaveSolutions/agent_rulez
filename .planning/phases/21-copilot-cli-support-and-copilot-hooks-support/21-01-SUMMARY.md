# Phase 21 Plan 01: Copilot CLI Support and Copilot Hooks Support Summary

**Copilot hook inputs now normalize into RuleZ events with preserved hook names and permissionDecision JSON outputs.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-12T23:12:21Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-12T23:16:21Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Added Copilot hook event parsing with explicit event mapping and tool_input preservation
- Implemented Copilot hook response translation to permissionDecision allow/deny
- Added adapter tests for mapping and response semantics

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add Copilot hook input normalization** - `861f9b0` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Translate RuleZ responses to Copilot JSON + tests** - `961e0fb` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit generated by gsd-tools)

## Files Created/Modified
- `cch_cli/src/adapters/copilot.rs` - Copilot hook parsing and response translation
- `cch_cli/src/adapters/mod.rs` - Adapter module export
- `cch_cli/src/models.rs` - Copilot hook response types
- `cch_cli/tests/copilot_adapter.rs` - Mapping and response translation tests

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
