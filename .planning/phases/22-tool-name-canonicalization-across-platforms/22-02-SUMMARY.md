# Phase 22 Plan 02 Summary

## What was done
- Created `docs/TOOL-MAPPING.md` documenting all canonical tool name mappings across platforms
- Includes mapping table, pass-through behavior, platform_tool_name preservation, confidence notes
- Format mirrors `docs/EVENT-MAPPING.md` for consistency

## Files modified
- `docs/TOOL-MAPPING.md` — new file

## Verification
- File exists with all 8+ canonical tool names documented
- Confidence levels noted (Gemini MEDIUM, OpenCode HIGH, Copilot LOW)
